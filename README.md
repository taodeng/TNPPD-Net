# Precise Positioning of Ultrasound-Guided Fine-needle Aspiration Biopsy of Thyroid Nodule

## In this paper, we construct the Thyroid Nodule Ultrasound (TNUS) dataset with thyroid nodule positions and puncture annotations, lacking in existing datasets. It supports future research in automating detection and diagnosis, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and clinical applications.

## We propose TNPPD-Net, a thyroid nodule puncture detection network integrating positional features. It has two branches: one for positional features, the other for localization features. They are fused to predict puncture positions. Our model excels on the TNUS dataset, with visualized key features supporting its effectiveness.
